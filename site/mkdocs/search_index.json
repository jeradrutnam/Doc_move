Additionally, all of this\nneeds to take place at the bat of an eyelid.\n\n\nA typical connected business of today relies on users who are constantly\non the move and using various applications and devices. These users are\nnow using their own devices for ease of access and prefer to sign in\njust once. Basically, the connected business caters to people who would\nlike to use their Facebook, Google, or LinkedIn credentials to access\nother information on their own devices. Here\u2019s the catch: an\nindividual\u2019s identity needs to be validated across these applications,\nand this needs to take place in a manner that will ensure security as\nwell as speed of access and ease of use.\u00a0\n\n\nIdentity management\n\n\nIdentity management is used to directly influence the security and\nproductivity of an organization. This can enforce consistency in\nsecurity policies across the organization. Identity management is\nparticularly advantageous when complying with rules and regulations\nenforced in some critical domains by governments. This can also be a\nmeans to provide access to resources to outside parties without\ncompromising security. Controlling access to resources increases\norganizational security. A system that uses a proper identity management\nsolution is easier to audit. Additionally, there are automated password\nreset capabilities.\n\n\nAn identity management system would typically have the following.\n\n\n\n\nUser stores and directories\n\n\nAuthentication of users\n\n\nAuthorization of users\n\n\nSingle sign-on\n\n\nProvisioning\n\n\nAccess delegation\n\n\nPassword reset\n\n\nSelf-registration\n\n\nAccount locking\n\n\n\n\nThe Identity Server and the solution it provides\n\n\nWSO2 Identity Server provides secure identity management for enterprise\nweb applications, services, and APIs by managing identity and\nentitlements of the users securely and efficiently.\u00a0The Identity Server\nenables enterprise architects and developers to reduce identity\nprovisioning time, guarantee secure online interactions, and deliver a\nreduced single sign-on environment. The WSO2 Identity Server decreases\nthe identity management and entitlement management administration burden\nby including the role-based access control (RBAC) convention,\nfine-grained policy-based access control, and Single-Sign-On (SSO)\nbridging.\n\n\nThe Identity Server enables you to create, maintain and terminate user\naccounts along with user identities across multiple systems including\nCloud applications.\u00a0When there are multiple applications that\nrequire\u00a0authentication, users should be able to log in at one place\u00a0and\nstill have seamless access to all the other applications.\n\n\nAdditionally, the Identity Server brings about a new and improved\napproach to federation. There is a centralized Identity as a Service\nProvider. It is still an overall n to n relationship. There is a 1 to n\nrelationship from a federation partner to consumer services (where\nmultiple consumer services rely on a single centralized federated\nIdentity Provider for security) and a 1 to n relationship from consumer\nservice to federation partners (where a single consumer service can rely\non multiple Identity providers for security). This model ensures greater\nefficiency.\n\n\nWSO2 Identity Server has the \u2018\nJaggery\n\u2019 user\ninterface for end users. Apart from the \nManagement\nConsole\n,\nan \nend user\nview\n\u00a0is\navailable to manage profiles, to recover accounts and to manage\nauthorized apps.\u00a0The log in and consent pages in the UI can be\ncompletely customized because they run on a separate context as a\nseparate web application. These web applications can even be dropped\ninto a separate application server if required.",

The WSO2 Identity Server decreases\nthe identity management and entitlement management administration burden\nby including the role-based access control (RBAC) convention,\nfine-grained policy-based access control, and Single-Sign-On (SSO)\nbridging.  The Identity Server enables you to create, maintain and terminate user\naccounts along with user identities across multiple systems including\nCloud applications.\u00a0When there are multiple applications that\nrequire\u00a0authentication, users should be able to log in at one place\u00a0and\nstill have seamless access to all the other applications.  Additionally, the Identity Server brings about a new and improved\napproach to federation. There is a centralized Identity as a Service\nProvider. It is still an overall n to n relationship. There is a 1 to n\nrelationship from a federation partner to consumer services (where\nmultiple consumer services rely on a single centralized federated\nIdentity Provider for security) and a 1 to n relationship from consumer\nservice to federation partners (where a single consumer service can rely\non multiple Identity providers for security). This model ensures greater\nefficiency.  WSO2 Identity Server has the \u2018 Jaggery \u2019 user\ninterface for end users. Apart from the  Management\nConsole ,\nan  end user\nview \u00a0is\navailable to manage profiles, to recover accounts and to manage\nauthorized apps.\u00a0The log in and consent pages in the UI can be\ncompletely customized because they run on a separate context as a\nseparate web application. These web applications can even be dropped\ninto a separate application server if required.",
